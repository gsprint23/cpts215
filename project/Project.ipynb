    "### Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For the final project in Cpts 215, you are going to implement your own data analytics system in pairs. As long as you conform to the requirements specified in this document, you will have the freedom to define the project topic, dataset, and the analysis performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overview of the project timeline is as follows:\n",
    "1. Schedule a meeting with your partner\n",
    "1. Brainstorm a project\n",
    "1. Write a project proposal\n",
    "1. Implement the project\n",
    "1. Present your project\n",
    "\n",
    "More details about these topics are in the following sections."

    "#### Brainstorm a Project\n",
    "With your partner, identify several topics that interest the both of you. For example, analytics applies to sports, politics, news, education, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, brainstorm data related to those topics that could be collected or may already exist. For example, if a topic you are both interested in is fitness, you could collect your own Fitbit data to analyze. If a topic you are interested in is climate change, you may search the internet to find publicly available datasets, web services you could query, or sites you can *ethically* scrape. A great place to start looking for open access datasets is [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, brainstorm problems related to the topic and data that are important to solve. For example, the Google Maps API graph mining case study we looked at solving important problems related to travel, commuting, and routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few project ideas to help get your creative juices flowing:\n",
    "* Mining current tweet trends/content using the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api), the [`twython`](https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library, and natural language processing (i.e. [n gram model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)).\n",
    "* Extending your decision tree code to implement a [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) classifier. Test your random forest on a machine learning dataset.\n",
    "* Implement [Google's PageRank algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) and apply it to a network of pages related to a current world affair.\n",
    "* Read about [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system). Implement a recommender system based on information scraped from the web or queried from APIs like [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) or [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/).\n",

    "#### Present the Project\n",
    "During dead week, each team will present their project. The presentation should be about 15 minutes in length and include the major topics of the proposal, some key components of the code, and a demo. After the 15 minute presentation, there will be time for the attendees of the presentation to ask questions. The instructor and at least 3 students will be in attendance of the presentation. Your team will be assigned one half hour time slot to present. The available time slots are listed below. In your project proposal, state all available time slots your team can present during dead week.\n",

    "Individually, you will be assigned 3 time slots to attend the presentation of other teams. Once the team presentation times have been identified, the above time table will be updated and you will need to email your instructor the presentations you are able to peer review. When you are attending another team's presentation, you will peer review your fellow students' projects and presentations. The rubric to use when peer reviewing is [available here](https://github.com/gsprint23/cpts215/blob/master/project/peer_evaluation.docx)."
