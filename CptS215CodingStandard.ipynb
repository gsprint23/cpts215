    "## Overview\n",
    "This document outlines the expectations of code organization and style for [CptS 215](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2017/cpts215/home). \n",
    "\n",
    "## File Names\n",
    "Source files (.py and .ipynb files) should have a name that describes your program. For example, a Python program to compute the area of various shapes could be called `area.py` instead of a non-informative name, such as `program.py`. For labs, it is recommended you name your python files for each task, e.g. `lab1task1.py`. For programming assignments, the assignment specification will state what to name your source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input/output files (e.g. .txt files, .csv files, etc.) should have a name that describes the content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programmer-Defined Identifiers\n",
    "Variables, functions, and classes should be named informatively. For example, do not name a variable, `variable`. The name should describe the value of the variable (i.e. `radius` for storing the radius of a circle), computation performed by the function (i.e. `compute_circumference()` to compute the circumference of a circle), or the semantics of the class (i.e. `Circle` to represent information and functionality related to circles). Thoughtful identifier names improves the readability of your code to yourself and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "Liberally comment your code! It helps you and others who may read your code. Also, should you use an algorithm, idea, or any other content that is not your own, use comments in your code to properly **cite your sources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inline Comments\n",
    "To describe the purpose of a line of code, it is beneficial to place comments throughout your code, not just when defining functions and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source File Comments\n",
    "Begin programs with a header section that indicates\n",
    "* Programmer's name\n",
    "* Date of current version\n",
    "* Brief description of what program does\n",
    "* The course (\"CptS 215\") \n",
    "* Assignment number (e.g., \"Programming Assignment #1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:"
