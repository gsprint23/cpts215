    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) refers to computational technique involving language. It is a broad field. For this assignment, we will learn a bit about NLP to build a predictive keyboard. The keyboard learns to make predictions by text given at startup and by things the user types into the program. As users type, the program predicts the most likely word given the currently entered word prefix. So for example, if the user has typed \"th\", the keyboard will probably predict \"the\". \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a hash map to implement the keyboard, which is crucial to making the keyboard's learning and predictions fast and efficient. For a hash map, we will use Python's built in dictionary object and our own `Map` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for this assignment, *do not use Jupyter Notebook* to code your solution. Use standard .py files."

    "### Program Details\n",
    "#### Background: Language Modeling 101\n",
    "Our predictive keyboard will make use of a very simple [model of language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model), a [*unigram language model*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model#Unigram_models). Our keyboard will keep track of every unique word it has seen. For each unique word, it will count how many times that word has occurred. A simple *maximum likelihood* estimate for the unigram probability of a word is to take the number of times you've seen that word occur divided by the total number of words you've encountered. For example, here is a small bit of text:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The cat is in the corner of their garage.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 9 total words in our text. Ignoring case and punctuation, the word the appears twice. The unigram probability of \"the\" is thus $P(the) = 2/9$. The unigram probability of \"cat\" is $P(cat) = 1/9$. The other six words: is, in, corner, of, their, garage all also have a probability of 1/9. If a word has never been seen, its probability is zero: $P(zebra) = 0/9 = 0.0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the data, if the user were to type in \"c\", both \"cat\" and \"corner\" are equally likely. But if they type \"ca\", we would predict \"cat\", while if they typed \"co\" we'd predict \"corner\". If the user typed \"ci\", we would make not prediction (since none of our words start with \"ci\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "Download the following text files ([keyboard_files.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/keyboard_files.zip)):\n",
    "1. [moby_start.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/moby_start.txt): The first paragraph from Moby-Dick (202 words).\n",

    "#### Classes to Define\n",
    "##### `Map`\n",
    "Implement a `Map` class that inherits from a `HashTable` class (see the class notes for much of this code). Your `HashTable` class should implement chaining for collision handling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I recommend first solving this assignment using the built in Python dictionary object. Once that is working, then replace the dictionaries with your `Map` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `DictEntry`\n",
    "We need a class to represent a word and its unigram probability. Here is the API to `DictEntry`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a new entry given a word and probability\n",
    "__init__(word, prob) # string, float \n",
    "# getter for the word \n",
    "get_word() # returns string\n",
    "# getter for the probability\n",
    "get_prob() # returns float\n",
    "# does this word match the given pattern?\n",
    "match_pattern(pattern) # returns string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `WordPredictor`\n",
    "The brains of this whole operation is the class `WordPredictor`. This class learns how to make word predictions based on being shown training data. It can learn from all the words in a file (via the `train()` method) or from a single individual word (via the `train_word()` method). After new training data is added, the `build()` method must be called so the class can recompute the most likely word for all possible prefixes. Here is the API for the `WordPredictor` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# train the unigram model on all the words in the given file\n",
    "train(training_file) # string\n",
    "# train on just a single word\n",
    "train_word(word) # string\n",
    "# get the number of total words we've trained on\n",
    "get_training_count() # returns integer\n",
    "# get the number of times we've seen this word (0 if never)\n",
    "get_word_count(word) # string. returns integer\n",
    "# recompute the word probabilities and prefix mapping\n",
    "build()\n",
    "# return the most likely DictEntry object given a word prefix\n",
    "get_best(prefix) # string. returns DictEntry\n",
    "```"

    "#### Training the Model\n",
    "Model training occurs in the `train()` and `train_word()` methods. `train()` should parse out each word in the specified file on disk. If the file cannot be read, it should print out an error, \"Could not open training file: file.txt\". All training words should be converted to lowercase and stripped of any characters that are not a-z or the single apostrophe. During training, you need to update the instance variables:\n",
    "* `word_to_count`: `Map` of string (word key) to integer (count value) pairs\n",
    "* `total`: Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `word_to_count` instance variable is a `Map` where the keys are the unique words encountered in the training data. The values are the integer count of how many times we've seen each word in the data. Only words seen in the training data will have an entry in the `word_to_count` `Map`. The total instance variable tracks how many words of training data we have seen. That is, total should equal the sum of all integer counts stored in your map. Training is cumulative for repeated calls to `train()` and `train_word()`, so you just keep increasing the counts stored in your `word_to_count` map and your total count of training words. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making Predictions\n",
    "The class needs to be able to predict the most probable word for a given word prefix give the statistics found during training. For example, after training on [mobydick.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/mobydick.txt), if the user types the prefix \"wh\", \"wha\", \"whal\" or \"whale\", the most likely word is \"whale\". The job of mapping word prefix strings to the most probable dictionary entry falls to the third instance variable:\n",
    "* `prefix_to_entry`: `Map` of string (prefix key) to `DictEntry` (value) pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Map` can map multiple keys to the same value. This is exactly what we need in this case since a set of strings (such as \"wh\", \"wha\", \"whal\" and \"whale\") may all need to map to a single `DictEntry` object. You need to ensure that each prefix maps to its most likely word. So even if the word \"thespian\" was encountered first in the training data, for any sensible training text, \"th\" should probably map to \"the\" and not \"thespian\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the `build()` method is called, you need to re-initialize the contents of `prefix_to_entry`. This ensures that you take into account any new words or updated counts present in `word_to_count`. Here is an overview of the algorithm you should be aiming for in `build()`:\n",
    "1. Loop over all possible (key, value) pairs in `word_to_count`.\n",
    "    1. For each pair: Calculate the probability of that word given its count and the number of training words. Create a new `DictEntry` object representing this word and its probability.\n",
    "    1. For each pair: Loop over all possible prefixes of the word. That is from a prefix of only the first letter to a \"prefix\" that is the entire word.\n",
    "        1. For each prefix, if the current key (word) has a probability strictly greater than what is currently stored for that prefix, replace the old value (a `DictEntry` object) with the new object.\n",
    "        \n",
    "This results in our map containing a mapping from every valid prefix of every training word to the most probable complete word under the unigram language model. Your `get_best()` method can be a one-liner! "

    "## Bonus (10 pts)\n",
    "1. (5 pts) Create a more advanced predictive keyboard that can show the top *N* possible completions for the current word. The value for N is passed as the first argument on the command-line. The interface should show up to N words that are consistent with the currently typed letters. Less than N words may be shown for some prefixes. The letters should be labeled with the numbers 0 up to N-1. If the user hits a number, the coorresponding predictions (if any) is output. The return key should select the best prediction. Try this using the [wiki_200k.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/wiki_200k.txt) file.\n",

(5 pts) Make your predictions depend on not only the current word prefix, but also on the prior word (i.e. a [*bigram language model*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model#n-gram_models)). Note that you might not always be able to make a prediction using the prior word (e.g. at the start of the sentence or if the prior word was never seen in the training data). This is a common problem in language modeling called *sparsity*. One way to handle this problem is to *backoff* to a lower-order language model. In your case, this would mean backing off to the unigram model which can always make a prediction as long as the current prefix is consistent with some word in the training data."
