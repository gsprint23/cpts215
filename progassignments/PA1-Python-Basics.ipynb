    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Write a program (`twitter_sort.py`) that merges and sorts two twitter feeds. At a high level, your program is going to perform the following:\n",
    "1. Read in two files containing twitter feeds.\n",
    "1. Merge the twitter feeds in reverse chronological order (most recent first).\n",
    "1. Write the merged feeds to an output file.\n",
    "1. Provide some basic summary information about the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The names of the files will be passed in to your program via command line arguments. Use the following input files to test your program: [tweet1.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/tweet1.txt) and [tweet2.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/tweet2.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of your program includes the following:\n",
    "1. Console\n",
    "    1. The name of the file that contained the most tweets followed by the number of tweets tweeted. In the event of a tie, print both filenames along with the number of tweets (Note: a file may be empty).\n",
    "    1. The five earliest tweets along with the tweeter.\n",
    "1. `sorted_tweets.txt`: the lines from the inputted files sorted in reverse chronological order (most recent tweets first and earliest tweets at the end)."

    "### Program Details\n",
    "#### File Format\n",
    "Each input file will contain a list of records with one record appearing on each line of the file. The format of a record is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`@TWEETER \"TWEET\" YEAR MONTH DAY HR:MN:SC`\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to read in each file and for each line in the file, create a record with the above information. In the above format, a tweet is a string that can contain a list of tokens. Also, HR:MN:SC should be treated as a single field of the record, the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you should remove the \"@\" symbol from each tweeter's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading from Files\n",
    "You may use the provided `Scanner` class in the [scanner.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/scanner.py) module to help you parse different fields from the tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions to Define\n",
    "In addition to a `main()` function, define the following functions in your code:\n",
    "* `read_records()`: a function that given a filename creates a `Scanner` object and creates a record for each line in the file and returns a list containing the records\n",
    "* `create_record()`: a function that takes in a `Scanner` object and creates a record then returns a list representing the record; note, the \"@\" symbol should also be removed from the tweeter's name\n",
    "* `is_more_recent()`: a function that compares two records based on date and returns `True` if the first record is more recent than the second and `False` otherwise\n",
    "* `merge_and_sort_tweets()`: a function that merges two lists of records based placing more recent records before earlier records and returns the merged records as a single list\n",
    "* `write_records()`: a function that takes in a list of records and writes to the file output each record on it's own line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Run\n",
    "File 1 ([tweet1_demo.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/tweet1_demo.txt)):\n",
