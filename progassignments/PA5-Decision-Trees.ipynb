    "### Program Details\n",
    "#### Background: K-fold Cross Validation\n",
    "In our example in class with the job candidate dataset, we trained our decision tree model on 14 examples. We then tested our model on 4 new examples that the model had not yet seen. We did not use these new examples to update the model. This approach to training and testing is called the *holdout method*. In the holdout method, the dataset is divided into two sets, the training and the testing set. The training set is used to build the model and the testing set is used to evaluate the model (e.g. the model's accuracy). One of the shortcomings of this approach is the evaluation of the model depends heavily on which examples are selected for training versus testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg/2000px-Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg.png\" width=\"650\">\n",
    "(image from [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg/2000px-Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg/2000px-Supervised_machine_learning_in_a_nutshell.svg.png))\n",
    "\n",
    "K-fold cross validation is a model evaluation approach that addresses this shortcoming of the holdout method. For K-fold cross validation, the examples are divided into k subsets $S = s_{1},...,s_{i},...,s_{k}$ and the holdout method is repeated k times. Each iteration $i$, subset $s_{i}$ is held out of the training set. Subsets $S - {s_{i}}$ are used for training and $s_{i}$ is used for testing. The average performance of all $k$ train/test trials is computed and evaluated. \n",
    "\n",

    "(image from [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/K-fold_cross_validation_EN.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/K-fold_cross_validation_EN.jpg))\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: K = 1 is called *leave-one-out* cross validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background: Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "While there are *several* classification evaluation metrics, we are only going to cover four of the most common classification evaluation metrics. For each machine learning model, compute the following metrics:\n",
    "1. Classification accuracy: the proportion of correct classifications made out of all classifications made: $$Accuracy = \\frac{\\# correct}{\\# correct + \\# incorrect}$$\n",
    "    * Note: Not useful when classes are imbalanced (e.g. 99% accuracy when 99% of the dataset is the positive class)\n",
    "1. Precision (positive predictive value): the proportion of correctly classified positives out of all classified positives: $$Precision = \\frac{\\# true positives}{\\# true positives + \\# false positives}$$\n",
    "    * A true positive is a positive example that is correctly classified as a positive example during testing\n",
    "    * A false positive is a negative example that is incorrectly classified as a positive example during testing\n",
    "1. Recall (true positive rate): the proportion of correctly classified positives out of all positives (regardless of classification): $$Recall = \\frac{\\# true positives}{\\# true positives + \\# false negatives}$$\n",
    "    * A false negative is a positive example that is incorrectly classified as a negative example during testing\n",
    "1. F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall: $$F1 = \\frac{2(precision \\times recall)}{precision + recall}$$\n",
    "    * Summarizes a classifier in a single number (however, it is best practice to still investigate precision and recall, as well as other evaluation metrics)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note: There is a trade-off between precision and recall. For a balanced class dataset, a model that predicts mostly positive examples will have a high recall and a low precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset\n",
    "Download [titanic.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/progassignments/files/titanic.txt). This dataset is from this [site](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/108515_e5d253e6997545e881759eb458b6ba61.html) and is a text file containing 2202 examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in this file is a comma-separated list of values representing attributes of passengers aboard the Titanic: \n",
    "* class: 0 = crew, 1 = first class, 2 = second class, 3 = third class\n",

For this dataset, there are 3 class labels representing different types of iris' (flowers): Setosa, Versicolour, and Virgninica. There are four attributes for each class example: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. There are 150 examples in the dataset."
