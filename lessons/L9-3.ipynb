    "## The Need for Balance\n",
    "The efficiency of a BST decreases as the tree becomes less balanced. As a motivating example, take a look at this randomly generated 500-node BST that has only been inserted into:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/lessons/figures/random_500BST.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "Now, take a look at the same BST after $500^{2}$ random mixture of insert/remove pairs of operations:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/lessons/figures/random_500BST2.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After randomly inserting N nodes into an empty BST, the average depth of a node is $\\mathcal{O}(log_{2}(N))$. After $\\mathcal{\\Theta}(N^{2})$ random insert/remove pairs into a N-node BST, the average depth of a node is $\\mathcal{\\Theta}(N^{1/2})$. How can we overcome problematic average cases and the worst case (sorted insertions) for BSTs?\n",
    "\n",
    "## AVL Trees\n",
    "In 1962, G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis designed a BST, called an AVL tree, that is balanced at all times. For every node in the AVL tree, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most 1. This balance requirement improves the efficiency of the BST for the cases specified earlier because the depth of a node is always $\\mathcal{\\Theta}(log_{2}(N))$ (even in the worst case!). Intuitively, the AVL balance requirement enforces that a tree is \"sufficiently\" populated before the height of the tree is grown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the minimum number of nodes $S(h)$ in an AVL tree of height $h$: $S(h) = S(h - 1) + S(h - 2) + 1 = \\mathcal{\\Theta}(2^{h})$ (Similar to the Fibonacci recurrence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a few examples:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/lessons/figures/AVL_tree_examples.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can maintain the balance condition, then the insert, remove, and find AVL tree operations are $\\mathcal{O}(log(N))$. To implement an AVL tree, we are going to keep track of a balance factor for each node in the tree. Upon inserting a node into the BST, we will consult the tree's balance factors to properly insert the node while maintaining balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balance Factor\n",
    "Each node in the tree is going to have a balance factor ($BF$) associated with it. The balance factor represents the difference between the height of the node's left subtree and the node's right subtree:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BF_{node} = height(leftsubtree) - height(rightsubtree)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree is balanced if its root node's balance factor is 0, left-heavy if it is positive, and right-heavy if it is negative. When $|BF| > 1$, we will re-balance the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "<img src=\"http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/images/AVL%20Example.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "(image from [http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/images/AVL%20Example.png](http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/images/AVL%20Example.png))\n",
    "\n",
    "###  AVL Tree Insertion\n",
    "When a new node is inserted into a BST, it is inserted as a leaf node. In an AVL tree, after the leaf node is inserted, we need to update the balance factors of the node's ancestors, until a balance factor is updated to 0 (the subtree is now balanced, no additional height was added by inserting the new node) or the root node has been reached. \n",

    "### AVL Tree Rebalancing\n",
    "If a subtree is out of balance enough to require rebalancing ($|BF| > 1$), we will bring the subtree back into balance by performing one ore more *rotations* on the tree. For example:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/lessons/figures/AVL_insert.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that after inserting a node into an AVL tree, there is a height violation at node $k$. There are 4 cases that can lead to height violation:\n",
    "1. CASE 1: Insert into the *left subtree* of the *left child* of $k$\n",
    "1. CASE 2: Insert into the *right subtree* of the *left child* of $k$\n",
    "1. CASE 3: Insert into the *left subtree* of the *right child* of $k$\n",
    "1. CASE 4: Insert into the *right subtree* of the *right child* of $k$\n",

    "\n",
    "Cases 1 and 4 are handled by a *single* rotation, and cases 2 and 3 are handled by a *double* rotation. A rotation is either a left rotation (for a right-heavy subtree, $BF < -1$) or a right rotation (for a left-heavy subtree, $BF > 1$). The general approach we will take to fix violations after AVL tree insertions using rotations is the following:\n",
    "1. Locate the deepest node with the height imbalance\n",
    "1. Locate which part of its subtree caused the imbalance\n",
    "    * This is the same as located the subtree site of insertion\n",
