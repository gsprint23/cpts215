    "## Linear vs Non-Linear Data Structures\n",
    "Stacks, queues, deques, and lists are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Collections such as these are often referred to as linear data structures. Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these ends are referred to as the \"left\" and the \"right\" or in some cases the \"front\" and the \"rear.\" You could also call them the \"top\" and the \"bottom.\" The names given to the ends are not significant. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end.\n",

    "Sets, dictionaries, trees, and graphs are examples of non-linear data collections. For non-linear structures, the relationship of adjacency is not maintained between the elements.\n",

    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "A linked list is a list of linked items with no requirement that the items are stored contiguously in memory. If we know the location of the first item in memory, the first item will tell us where the second item is (they are linked), and the second item will tell us where the third item is, and so on. We need to store an external reference to the first item in the list to maintain access to the list. This external reference is called the *head* of the list. \n",

    "\n",
    "There are many different implementation of linked lists, such as singly linked, doubly linked (nodes store links to previous nodes in the list), ordered, circular linked (last node stores a link to the first node), and with/without a dummy head node. Depending on the needs of the linked list, different implementations may be deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since linked lists were covered in detail in the prerequisite courses for CptS 215, we will take a look at a singly linked list implementation in detail and analyze the efficiency of common linked list operations such as `insert()` and `remove()`.\n",

    "A set is an *unordered collection with no duplicate elements*. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Set Abstract Data Type\n",
    "* `Set()`: creates a new set that is empty. It needs no parameters and returns an empty set.\n",
    "* `add(item)`: adds a new item to the set making sure that there are no duplicates of the item. It needs the item and returns nothing. \n",
    "* `remove(item)`: removes the item from the set. It needs the item and modifies the set. \n",
    "* `search(item)`: searches for the item in the set. It needs the item and returns a boolean value.\n",
    "* `is_empty()`: tests to see whether the set is empty. It needs no parameters and returns a boolean value.\n",
    "* `size()`: returns the number of items in the set. It needs no parameters and returns an integer.\n",
    "* `union(others)`: returns a set with elements from the set and all others in the list. Overloads the `|` operator.\n",
    "* `intersection(others)`: returns a new set with elements common to the set and all others in the list. Overloads the `&` operator.\n",
    "* `difference(others)`: returns a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others. Overloads the `-` operator.\n",
    "* `symmetric_difference(other)`: returns a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both. Overloads the `^` operator.\n",
    "* `subset(other)`: test whether every element in the set is in other. Returns a boolean value. Overloads the `<=` operator.\n",
    "* `proper_subset(other)`: Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, `set <= other and set != other`. Returns a boolean value. Overloads the `<` operator.\n",
    "* `superset(other)`: test whether every element in other is in the set. Returns a a boolean value. Overloads the `>=` operator.\n",
    "* `proper_subset(other)`: test whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, `set >= other and set != other`. Returns a boolean value. Overloads the `>` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the set ADT is straightforward using a Python list with restrictions on adding items to the set. This is a practice problem included at the end of this lesson. For now, to show an example of how sets work, we will use the built-in set type in Python. Curly braces or the `set()` function can be used to create sets. \n",
