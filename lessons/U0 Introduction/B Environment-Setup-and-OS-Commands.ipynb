    "## The Command Line\n",
    "Instead of using graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to interface with our OS, we can type commands at the command line (AKA command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Unix-based machines). The OS you use determines what commands are available. The three main OSs in use today are Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Both Mac OS X and Linux are Unix-based OSs, meaning they are derived from the [Unix OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). In this lesson, we are going to cover several OS commands for both Windows and Unix-based machines.\n",

    "## Navigating the File System\n",
    "Your OS manages your file system. You can think of a file system as a tree structure, with the root node being the top-level folder (e.g. C:\\ on Windows or / on Unix-based machines). Child nodes of the root node are folders/files in the top-level folder, and so on and so forth. Leaf nodes are files and empty folders.\n",

    "When you launch the command prompt, the command prompt is operating in a folder (AKA a directory). The current folder is called the *current working directory*, or the CWD. In the command prompt, to the left of the cursor is the actual prompt, which denotes the CWD. You can also display the CWD with the following commands:\n",

    "If a file you want to interact with is in a directory other than the CWD, you will have to specify its path. The location of a file is represented by its path, the sequence of folders that the file is stored in, plus the file's name. There are two ways to specify a path:\n",
    "1. Relative path: a path to a file or directory relative to the current directory.\n",
    "1. Absolute path: a path to a file or directory specified by its exact location on your file system. An absolute path *uniquely* identifies the location of a file/folder on a file system.\n",

We know the backslash has a special purpose in Python, to escape certain characters, such as a newline \"\\n\"; therefore, you will have to escape a backslash: \"`\\\\`\" in your path to a file: `\"files\\\\transactions.txt\"`. Alternatively, you can specify your path as a raw string: `r\"files\\transactions.txt\"`. On a Unix-based machine (e.g. Mac, Linux distributions), the forward slash \"/\" is used in paths and you don't have to worry about this issue.\n",

    "## Viewing the Environment Variables\n",
    "Environment variables are a set of values that can affect the way programs (such as the operating system, the terminal, etc.) run on a computer. For example, the path environment variable specifies all of the directories where executable programs are located. For example, when you launch the Python interpreter from a command prompt, python.exe (the Python interpreter) is located by a search of the directories specified in the path environment variable.\n",

    ">An IP address (abbreviation of Internet Protocol address) is an identifier assigned to each computer and other device (e.g., printer, router, mobile device, etc.) connected to a TCP/IP network[1] that is used to locate and identify the node in communications with other nodes on the network. IP addresses are usually written and displayed in human-readable notations, such as 172.16.254.1 in IPv4, and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address):\n",
    ">A media access control address (MAC address) of a computer is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. MAC addresses are used as a network address for most IEEE 802 network technologies, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Logically, MAC addresses are used in the media access control protocol sublayer of the OSI reference model. MAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface controller (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, such as the card's read-only memory or some other firmware mechanism.\n",
