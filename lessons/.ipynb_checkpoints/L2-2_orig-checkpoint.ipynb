    "## Programming Errors\n",
    "Rarely will you write a program that is free of errors. You'll need to diagnose and correct three kinds of errors:\n",
    "1. Syntax errors (code violates syntax rules for a proper Python program)\n",
    "    * Detected at compile time\n",
    "    * Program will not run unless they're corrected\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Undeclared identifiers\n",
    "        * Invalid identifiers (e.g. a space in a variable name)\n",
    "        * Failure to close a comment or string properly\n",
    "        * Incorrect indenting (we will learn about indenting when we learn about functions)\n",
    "2. Run-time errors\n",
    "    * Cause the program to \"crash\": an error is reported, and control is turned over to the operating system\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Division by zero\n",
    "        * Getting into an infinite loop, which may ultimately cause a \"stack overflow\"\n",
    "3. Logic Errors\n",
    "    * Cause the program to compute incorrect results\n",
    "    * Often go unnoticed, at least at first\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Your algorithm is wrong because you misunderstand the problem\n",
    "        * You do not obtain input data properly, so your computations work on the wrong data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software Development Method\n",
    "Equivalent to the \"Scientific Method\" in the sciences and the \"Systems Approach\" in business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Six basic steps:\n",
    "1. Specify problem requirements\n",
    "1. Analyze the problem\n",
    "1. Design an algorithm to solve the problem\n",
    "1. Implement the algorithm\n",
    "1. Test and verify the completed program\n",
    "1. Maintain and update the program\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing software is an iterative process, your first solution is generally not your best. Your understanding of software your required to build evolves as you understand the problem more. At this point don't be afraid to make mistakes!\n",
