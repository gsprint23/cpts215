    "## Why Use Functions?\n",
    "* Break a large, complex solution into logical units\n",
    "    * Individual members of a programming team can work on each unit independently\n",
    "* Procedural abstraction \n",
    "    * The calling function need not be aware of the details of how a function works—just what it does\n",
    "    * Thus, during high-level problem solving activities, we won't get bogged down in detail\n",
    "* Reuse\n",
    "    * Recall our comment on the original version of the program to compute and display the gpa of classes\n",
    "        * Redundant: Much code was duplicated\n",
    "    * Why re-write sections of code that have already been written and tested?\n",
    "    * Functions allow us to package up a well-designed solution into a **bite-size chunk that can be reused over and over**\n",
    "        * Name a group of statements for easier reading and debugging\n",
    "* Testing\n",
    "    * Allows for more efficient testing and bug resolution\n",
    "    * Each function is tested as it is implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Functions are Executed\n",
    "* When a function is called, memory for local variables is allocated\n",
    "* Memory is released upon completion of function execution (local function variables do not \"outlive\" function)\n",

When the function is executed, the value 3.4 is *copied* into a **new local variable**, `gpa`. We call `gpa` a local variable because the variable is only accessible within `display_gpa()` on this particular functional call (`display_gpa(3.4)`).\n",
