    "## Graph Overview\n",
    "We are quite familiar with the concept of a graph (the web of connections kind, not the plot kind). For example:\n",
    "* Airport system: each airport is connected by airline routes/flights\n",
    "* Internet: each computing device is connected by data transmission infrastructure\n",
    "* Power grid: each building is connected via power lines\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "A graph is a data structure representing connections (edges) between items (vertices). A vertex (or node) is an item in a graph. An edge (or link) is a connection between two vertices in a graph. Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, the set $V$ is the set of all vertices in $G$: $V = \\{v_{1}, ..., v_{i}, ..., v_{n}\\}$ and the set $E$ is the set of all edges in $G$: $E = \\{e_{1}, ..., e_{j}, ..., e_{m}\\}$ where $e_{j} = (v_{k}, v_{l})$ is an edge connecting vertices $v_{k}$ and $v_{l}$.\n",
