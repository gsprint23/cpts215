If two vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$ are adjacent, then there is a 1 in the $i$th row and $j$th column in the matrix. If two vertices are not adjacent, then a 0 is placed in the respective row and column.\n",

With the adjacency matrix, we either need to store an object (such as a tuple or an instance of a custom `Vertex` class) instead of 1 or we need to maintain a parallel matrix with this information. With the adjacency list, we can modify our keys to be instances of a custom `Vertex` class.\n",

Then, the adjacency list is a dictionary of vertex names (keys) and `Vertex` objects (values). We will define a `Graph` class to wrap this adjacency list dictionary with our graph ADT methods:\n",
    "1. `add_vertex(vert)` adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.\n",

    "1. `get_vertex(vert_key)` finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.\n",
    "1. `get_vertices()` returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
