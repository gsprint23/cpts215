    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson is going to be a collection of online resources for learning about Git and Github. While it is important to learn the fundamentals of these tools by reading the following materials, the best way to learn is to actually play with these tools. Follow along on your own machine where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control\n",
    "From the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control):\n",
    ">What is \"version control\", and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    ">If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a popular VCS that is the version control software that GitHub is built on. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. People from all over the world (or in the exact same place) can work together on projects. Code that is hosted on GitHub can be either public or private.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "First, make a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Code hosted with a free GitHub account is public by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We also have GitHub enterprise in our EECS department where you can privately code: [github.eecs.wsu.edu](https://github.eecs.wsu.edu/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow this Hello World tutorial on Github: [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). This tutorial walks you through the following:\n",
    "1. Create a repository. A repository is a folder that organizes your GitHub project. Files and folders in your repository are version controlled. You should always include a README.md file in each of your repositories. README files are markdown files (yay!) that describe your repository. Read more about README.md files [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/). \n",
    "1. Create a branch. A branch is a version of the repository that someone is working on. The \"master\" branch of your repository is the main branch. When you are going to work on a new feature of the software, you will make a new branch off of the master branch. This new branch is a copy of the master branch. When you are done implementing your new feature, you merge your branch back into master.\n",
    "1. Create a commit. A commit is a change to file(s) in the repository that you want to save.\n",
    "1. Create a pull request. When you make a pull request, you are asking someone to pull in your proposed changes from your branch to be merged with another branch (usually master). \n",
    "1. Merge a pull request.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Git\n",
    "So far, we have been using GitHub via its browser interface for simple non-code edits. More commonly, you will be writing code locally on your machine. You will then want to *push* the code changes from your local repository to the repository on GitHub via a command line interface. To do this, we will use Git and Git commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, install Git onto your machine: [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow this Git/GitHub tutorial: [http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). This tutorial walks you through the following:\n",
    "1. Create a git repository (`init` command). \n",
    "1. Stage a file. Using the `add` command, this step tells Git which files you want to package into a commit.\n",
    "1. Create a commit (`commit` command).\n",
    "1. Create a branch (`branch` command).\n",
    "1. Add a local repository to GitHub (`remote add` command).\n",
    "1. Push local changes to GitHub (`push` command).\n",
    "1. Update your local repository with the most up to date code on GitHub (`pull` command).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tutorial for beginners to check out is this one on Udacity: [http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is great graphic that summarizes the Git commands learned so far (no need to worry about reverting and comparing for now).\n",

    "\n",
    "## GitHub Classroom\n",
    "GitHub has a site called [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) that we will use for CptS 215. GitHub Classroom automates repository creation and access control for assignments in courses like ours. The repositories can be public, private to the students in the class, or private to everyone except the instructor. Here is our [Cpts 215 Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/27835955-wsucpts215classroom). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice Problem\n",
    "For practice, I have made a \"classroom-hello-world\" assignment. Here is the invitation link to this assignment: [https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/a4a71df65861adafe1cab9eb41667f39](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/a4a71df65861adafe1cab9eb41667f39). Open the above link and follow the instructions. Practice working with GitHub classroom by customizing the README for your repository and pushing a simple hello world Python script to \"classroom-hello-world\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the current setting for classroom-hello-world assignment is public, meaning everyone is able to see your repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "There are many details behind Git that can be overwhelming to try and learn all at once. For this class, I only want to introduce you to the basics. When you work on a larger scale project, such as your senior design project or one for an internship at a software company, you will gain more practical exposure to Git (or other version control systems like [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) or [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use GitHub Classroom for the final project in CptS 215. You will be working in teams and will need to collaborate online on code that is version controlled. The main Git/GitHub functionality you should be familiar with for the project includes the following:\n",
    "1. Managing repositories on GitHub\n",
    "1. Branching and merging\n",
    "1. Staging, committing, and pushing local changes via the Git command line interface\n",
    "\n",
    "I definitely recommend printing a Git cheat sheet and keeping it posted near your computer. Here is an example cheat sheet that I have!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-w6jLVR80lfs/VZZU9tRXwPI/AAAAAAAAAWo/ctqcKpWJ1EI/s1600/github-git-cheatsheet-page-001.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, GitHub is a great way to showcase your undergraduate projects (both in class projects and out of class side projects). Potential employers may look at your GitHub account to see your coding style and coding interests."
