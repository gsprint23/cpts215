    "## Priority Queues\n",
    "A priority queue is a queue that orders the items in the queue by their *priority*. The items with the highest priority are at the front of the queue and the items with the lowest priority are at the back of the queue. If a very high priority item is enqueued, it will be stored toward (or possibly) at the front of the queue. It will thus be one of the first (or the first) items dequeued from the queue. \n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/lessons/figures/heap1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We could adapt our queue code from several weeks ago to be an implementation of a priority queue. We can enqueue items into the queue in sorted order. Such an algorithm would be $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ for inserting items and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for removing the highest priority item. In fact, there are several data structures we could use to implement a priority queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Data structure|Insert|Remove highest priority|\n",
    "|-|-|-|\n",
    "|Unordered linked list|$\\mathcal{O}(1)$|$\\mathcal{O}(n)$|\n",
    "|Ordered linked list|$\\mathcal{O}(n)$|$\\mathcal{O}(1)$|\n",
    "|Balanced BST|$\\mathcal{O}(log n)$|$\\mathcal{O}(log n)$|\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we are going to cover a new data structure that is more suited for a priority queue implementation. The new data structure, a binary heap, has a *special* tree-like structure that supports inserting and removing items with $\\mathcal{O}(log n)$ efficiency. The special tree is called a *binary heap*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Heaps\n",
    "A binary heap is a binary tree with two properties:\n",
    "1. Structure property\n",
    "1. Heap order property\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary heap is going to be implemented as a balanced binary tree in order to keep enqueue and dequeue $\\mathcal{O}(log n)$. A binary heap is usually a min heap or a max heap. A *min* heap maintains the smallest items at the front of the queue. A *max* heap maintains the largest items at the front of the queue. We will derive the interface and implementation of a min heap, though the implementation of the max heap is nearly the same."

    "### Structure Property\n",
    "We will keep the heap balanced by creating the heap as a *complete binary tree*. Each level in a complete binary tree is full, except for the bottom level of the tree. The bottom level of the tree will be filled from left to right. The height of a complete binary tree with $N$ items is $floor(log_{2}(N))$.\n",

    "\n",
    "While we can store a complete binary tree in an object oriented fashion (nodes and links), we can more conveniently store it as a single list using indexes and offsets. Let a parent node $p$ be at index $i$ in the list. \n",
    "* The left child of $p$ is at index $2 * i$. \n",
    "* The right child of $p$ is at index $2 * i + 1$. \n",
    "* The parent of any node $n$ at index $i$ is at index $i // 2$. \n",

    "\n",
    "This storage of a complete binary tree in a single list lends itself well to efficient traversals and an efficient binary heap implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The first item at index 0 is 0. This is defined as such so the integer division used to lookup parent nodes results in the root node (smallest item in the heap) being at index position 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Since the list stores a complete binary tree, all nodes past the half way point in the list (`len(list)` // 2) are leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Order Property\n",
    "In a heap, for every node `x` with parent node `p`, the item in `p` is smaller than or equal to the key in `x`. A tree that upholds the heap property will always have the smallest item in the root node. \n",
    "\n",

    "When we want to dequeue from the priority queue, we will delete the minimum item from the min heap. The minimum item is always at the root node so we will have to remove the root to delete the minimum key. To do this, we will decrease the heap size by one, move the last item in the heap to the root (maintains heap structure property) and \"percolate\" the element down while the heap order property is not satisfied.
