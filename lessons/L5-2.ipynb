    "## Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving problems by breaking a problem down into increasingly smaller subproblems until the subproblem is small enough to be solved trivially. A *recursive algorithm* is an algorithm that solves a problem using recursion. Recursive algorithms have the following characteristics:\n",
    "1. A base case (the small subproblem that can be trivially solved)\n",
    "2. Progress towards the base case\n",
    "3. It calls itself, recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a recursive solution, we typically define *recursive functions*. A recursive function is a function that either directly or indirectly calls itself. \n",

    "## Tail Recursion\n",
    "If the *last* instruction of a function is another functional call (be it itself or some other function), this is called tail recursion. Here are a few examples of tail recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this is tail recursion because foo's stack space is not released until the call to bar returns\n",
    "def foo(a):\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "    bar(a)\n",
    "    \n",
    "# example of tail recursion where a function calls itself at the end instead of some other function\n",
    "def foo1(a):\n",
    "    if a <= 1:\n",
    "        return\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "    foo1(a - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a recursive function that does not have tail recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return 1\n",
    "    return n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even though the above may appear like a tail recursion, it is NOT. The reason is that the last instruction in the `factorial(n)` is not `factorial(n-1)` but it is the multiplication operation between n and the answer of `factorial(n-1)`. In other words, because there is some operation that is left to happen inside `factorial(n)` after the call to `factorial(n-1)` returns, it is not a case of tail recursion, and what that means is that it is imperative to keep the function space of `factorial(n) alive during the entire execution of `factorial(n-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does Tail Recursion Matter?\n",
    "The answer is - it depends! Tail recursion is bad because it allows an unnecessary growth in stack space and could be a cause of stack overflows. In some cases, we may be able to easily avoid stack overflow by replacing tail recursion with an iteration. However, there is no guarantee that eliminating tail recursion will always provide this benefit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Eliminating Tail Recursions\n",
    "Let an arbitrary recursive function have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",

    "    1. \\{$\\ldots$\\} # do something   \n",
