    "## Python Basics\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It is an open source, general-purpose language. It is flexible and powerful, yet still simple enough to be quickly picked up by new programmers. Python is fairly high on the high-level programming languages spectrum, meaning its syntax and grammar is fairly close to pseudo-code.\n",

    "Python can be run on any computer architecture, so long as a Python interpreter is installed on the machine. This is similar to Java in the sense that as long as Java (more specifically, a Java Virtual Machine) is installed on your computer (you've seen the pesky Java update dialogs), you can run Java code written on any other architecture. It is convenient, cross-platform approach to application development. In contrast to *interpreted languages*, *compiled languages* are translated into specific computer architecture machine code (i.e. for a specific Intel processor instead of an AMD processor). Interpreted languages, such as Python and Java, tend to run slower than compiled languages, such as C and Fortran. \n",

This is where you explain what the function does, what inputs it expects, what outputs it produces, what assumptions the function makes, etc. When you type `help(<function_name>)`, the text in the docstring is what shows up (cool!).\n",
