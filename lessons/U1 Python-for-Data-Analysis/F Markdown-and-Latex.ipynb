    "## Markdown Overview\n",
    "Before talking about Markdown, let's talk about [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (hypertext markup language). HTML is used to build content for websites. HTML is characterized by tags, which are angle brackets < > used to \"label\" content. You have probably seen HTML before, maybe something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "`<h1>This is a header</h1>`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the text \"This is a header\" is labeled as a first (top) level header. If you want to learn more about HTML (and CSS and Javascript), I recommend starting with [this Codeacademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about Markdown. Like HTML, Markdown is used to build content for websites; however, Markdown is much easier to learn and simpler to read. For example, let's look at the previous HTML header example in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# This is a header`\n",
    "\n",
    "The # symbol denotes a header, and the number of # symbols denotes a header level. Now let's dive into the Markdown (and a little bit of HTML) you will need for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You have likely seen Markdown in use before. Github and Reddit use it to format comments. In fact, [README.md](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/) files on Github are Markdown files (md is for markdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **In addition to following along in these notes, I highly recommend following [this Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/)** for extra practice and to learn more above and beyond what is presented here."

    "### Header Level 3\n",
    "#### Header Level 4\n",
    "##### Header Level 5\n",
    "###### Header Level 6\n",
    "Each header (except for level 1) represents a sub section of previous, higher level headers. A phrase is specified as a header by beginning with the # symbol. The number of # symbols denotes the level of the header. For example, this cell is under the `### Headers` header, which is a level 3 header."
