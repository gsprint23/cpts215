    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before taking this course, you need to satisfy the prerequisites listed [here](http://www.catalog.wsu.edu/Pullman/Academics/Courses/CPT_S).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The primary aim of this course is to further expand your understanding of data analytics and algorithms. In this course, we use the Python programming language and libraries to explore the fundamental concepts, constructs, and techniques of modern data analytics systems including: program structures, algorithms, and Big Data sets. Some of these concepts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
    "* Analyzing and applying data structures -trees, maps, hash tables, etc.\n",
    "* Implementing algorithms and data structures in Python\n",
    "* Designing and applying systems for data analysis\n",
    "* Problem solving with data structures and design techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will emphasize problem solving, algorithmic thinking, and data extraction, filtering, and analysis. Please see the tentative topic schedule listed at the bottom of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general rule-of-thumb is that you will get as much out of the course as effort that you put into it, so please work diligently and you will be rewarded for the work that you put into the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this course, you should be able to:\n",
    "* Analyze and apply core data structures for data analytics\n",
    "* Analyze and apply core algorithms for data analytics\n",
    "* Design, implement, and test Python programs applying modern tools and techniques\n",
    "* Extract, filter, transform, and computationally analyze data\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, this course targets the WSU and ABET [outcomes](https://abet.eecs.wsu.edu/curricular/CptS) listed [here](https://abet.eecs.wsu.edu/node/417). Please refer to [http://school.eecs.wsu.edu/undergraduate/ABET](http://school.eecs.wsu.edu/undergraduate/ABET) for more information. "

Academic integrity will be strongly enforced in this course. Students who violate WSU's Academic Integrity Policy (identified in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 504-26-010(3) and -404) will fail the course, will not have the option to withdraw from the course pending an appeal, and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration as defined in the Standards of Conduct for Students, WAC 504-26-010(3). You need to read and understand all of the definitions of cheating: [http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=504-26-010](http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=504-26-010). \n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to know and understand Washington State University Academic Integrity Policies. Copying and plagiarism of other sources will result in an automatic F on the assignment. For a second offense, an automatic F in the course will be awarded without the option to withdraw. University authorities will be notified and the proper procedures will be followed. Possible outcomes resulting from violating these policies include denial of certification into your program and expulsion.\n",

    "Note: If you use content from sources other than the ones provided by the instructor (e.g. textbook, notes, etc.), cite the source in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are few example scenarios (adapted from Aaron Crandall's CptS 223 Syllabus):\n",
    "1. You and a few friends are working together on an individual assignment. You just finished the assignment but have to head to class. One of your friends asks you for a copy of your work so that he/she can use it as a guide. Wanting to be a good friend, you email him/her a copy of your assignment on the promise that he/she won't copy. \n",
    "    * Is this cheating? YES! You are violating implementation detail #3 (above) and your friend is violating implementation detail #4. \n",
    "1. You and a few friends are working together on an individual assignment. You just finished the assignment but have to head to class. One of your friends asks to meet up with you later for some help. You meet up with him/her after class and answer his/her questions with high-level descriptions on a white board (e.g. \"here is an example of how a for loop works\") and pictures (e.g. a drawing).\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. Your friend is almost done with his individual assignment but is stuck debugging. You take a look at his/her program and quickly realize that his/her loop is off by one. You explain how to fix the error to your friend.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. On Piazza, a student has asked for code help on an individual assignment. You respond with a short code snippet.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? No, this kind of working together is encouraged.\n",
    "1. You are stuck on an individual assignment, say coding a Hangman game, and turn to Google to help you out. You find code that completely implements the game of Hangman! You download the code, modify it to meet the assignment requirements, and turn it in.\n",
    "    * Is this cheating? YES! This is plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "If are unsure of whether a situation might be considered cheating, be cautious and don't do it. If help is required please ask the instructor or TA for guidance. We are always more than willing to help!!\n",

    "The Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture offers free tutoring for students in CptS 215. For more information and the tutor schedule, see [https://vcea.wsu.edu/tutors/](https://vcea.wsu.edu/tutors/).\n",

    "### Advice\n",
    "The fastest (and easiest) way to get better at programming is to program! This course moves fast and if you don't stay on top of the assignments and reading it will be difficult to catch up. You will do great in the course if you put the time in to learn the material on schedule and practice programming data structures :)"
