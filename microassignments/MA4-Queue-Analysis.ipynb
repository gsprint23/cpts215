    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For this micro assignment, you are going to download this Jupyter Notebook and answer the following questions. Your answer for a problem should be in a cell *immediately* after the problem cell. *Do not modify the problem cell.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to explore the efficiency of two different queue implementations. This micro assignment includes conceptional questions and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Questions\n",
    "Suppose you are given a (strange) computer that can only perform the following instructions (in addition to if and while):\n",
    "* `S = create_stack()` create stack makes a new stack `S`\n",
    "* `i = S.pop()` removes the top item from stack `S` and places it in variable `i`\n",
    "* `S.push(i)` makes item `i` the top item in stack `S`\n",
    "\n",
    "Solve the following problems and *justify* your answers:\n",
    "1. (10 pts) Show how you can use these operations to implement a queue (operations `Q = create_queue()`, `enqueue(i)`, `i = dequeue()`)\n",
    "    * A picture might help to explain your answer\n",
    "    * Hint: take a look at the following image:\n",
    "<img src=\"http://www.algoqueue.com/algoqueue/members/get_uploaded_image.load/149\" width=\"500\">\n",

    "1. (5 pts) What's the worst case running time of your dequeue implementation?\n",
    "1. (5 pts) Over a series of `n` enqueues followed by `n` dequeues, how many `pop()` operations does your implementation perform?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Questions\n",
    "Write a program that implements a queue using a standard list implementation (see [M&R 3.12](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/ImplementingaQueueinPython.html)) and a queue using your solution to conceptual question #1. For the latter, you must implement a stack using a standard list implementation (see [M&R 3.5](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/BasicDS/ImplementingaStackinPython.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a sequence of `enqueue`s and `dequeue`s to test your two queue implementations. To generate the test sequence, randomly `enqueue` and `dequeue` strings from [words.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/microassignments/files/words.txt), a file containing all 118,309 valid crossword puzzle words, one on each line. Evaluate the differences between the two implementations by performing the following:\n",
    "1. Using [`timeit()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html), compare the running time for each queue implementation operating on your test sequence. Vary the size of your test sequence.\n",
    "    * Note: Make sure you are using the same test sequence for each implementation! Also, remove all frivolous code from your implementations (e.g. `print()` statements), as these can affect the timing!\n",
    "1. Write code to test your answer to conceptual question #2. Write up your observations.\n",
    "1. Write code to test your answer to conceptual question #3. Write up your observations."

    "* 20 pts for answering the conception questions\n",
    "* 5 pts for correct implementation of the list-based queue\n",
    "* 10 pts for correct implementation of the stack-based queue\n",
    "* 5 pts for `timeit()` results\n",
    "* 5 pts for observation write ups\n",
    "* 5 pts for for adherence to proper programming style and comments established for the class"
