    "### Conceptual Questions\n",
    "Solve the following problems and *justify* your answers:\n",
    "1. For the following binary tree:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/microassignments/figures/ma5_tree.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Is the tree full? \n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Is the tree complete?\n",

    "    1. List the nodes in the tree in the order they would be visited during a:\n",
    "        1. (4 pts) Pre-order traversal\n",
    "        1. (4 pts) Level-order traversal\n",
    "        1. (4 pts) Post-order traversal\n",
    "        1. (4 pts) In-order traversal\n",
    "1. (2 pts) What is the time complexity to search a full BST?\n",
    "1. The following questions refer to the same BST. The operations are cumulative:\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Show the BST that would result from inserting the items 35, 20, 30, 50, 45, 60, 18, 25 in this sequence.\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Show the BST that would result after removing item 35 (promote in order successor).\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Show the BST that would result after removing item 18 (promote in order successor).\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) How would the trees in the previous problems look differently if we promote in order predecessors instead of successors?\n",
    "1. (2 pts) Given the following tree, perform the appropriate rotations to bring it back into balance:\n",

    "### Implementation Question\n",
    "Write a program that implements and tests an AVL tree `remove(item)` method. This method accepts an item to remove. If the item is in the tree, the method removes the item, re-balances the tree, and returns `True`. If the item is not in the tree, `False` is returned."
