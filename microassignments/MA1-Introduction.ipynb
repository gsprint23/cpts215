    "## Overview and Requirements\n",
    "For this micro assignment you are going to introduce yourself via a Piazza post, use the command line to setup a directory hierarchy for this class, and write a basic Python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Piazza Post (10 pts)\n",
    "1. Open the Piazza homepage: [https://piazza.com/wsu/fall2017/cpts215/home](https://piazza.com/wsu/fall2017/cpts215/home) and click on the Q&A tab. In the upper left corner of the Q&A tab, click the blue \"New Post\" button:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/microassignments/figures/piazza_post_button.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "You should see a page that looks like the following:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts215/master/microassignments/figures/piazza_blank_post.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "1. Description of posting options:\n",
    "    1. Select \"Entire Class\" if you are posting a concept question or if you are posting a *short code snippet*. All members of the CptS 215 Piazza page will see your post.\n",
    "    1. Select \"Individual Student(s)/Instructor(s) if you are posting content that you do not want the entire class to see. For example, if you have a coding question that requires more than a code snippet, post your code to Instructors.\n",
    "    1. Select which folder is most relevant for your post\n",
    "    1. Details\n",
    "        1. If you are going to post a code snippet, click the code button to insert a \"code block\". Paste your code into this code block.\n",
    "        1. If you are going to attach a file (such as a .py or .zip file), click on \"Insert\" and select \"Insert file\" from the drop down menu.\n",
    "1. Now, make a post in Piazza to the entire class. Tag your post in the \"general\" folder. Your post should contain the following information about yourself:\n",
    "    1. (1 pt) Your name\n",
    "    1. (1 pt) Your major\n",
    "    1. (1 pt) Where currently live\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) Why are you taking CptS 215\n",
    "    1. (2 pts) What do you want to do with data analytics?\n",
    "    1. (3 pts) A picture of something fun you did from the most recent break (e.g. summer break or winter break) (from the \"Insert\" menu, select \"Insert image\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Take a screenshot of your Piazza post and save it into an image file (e.g. .png, .jpg, etc.) called `piazza_post.png`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command Line (20 pts)\n",
    "Using the OS commands learned in [L1-2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gsprint23/cpts215/blob/master/lessons/L1-2.ipynb), you are going to create a folder hierarchy suitable for this class. Perform the following:\n",
    "1. Open the command prompt\n",
    "1. Navigate to a folder where you would like to store files for this class (e.g. Documents, Desktop, etc.)\n",
    "1. Create a folder called `cpts215`\n",
    "1. Navigate into `cpts215`\n",
    "1. Create the following folders:\n",
    "    1. `lesson_notes`\n",
    "    1. `prog_assignments`\n",
    "    1. `micro_assignments`\n",
    "    1. `project`\n",
    "1. Navigate into `micro_assignments`\n",
    "1. Create a directory called `MA1`\n",
    "1. Navigate into `MA1`\n",
    "1. Create a new .py file called `primality_test.py`\n",
    "1. Navigate back to `cpts215`\n",
    "1. Get a long listing of the files in `cpts215`\n",
    "1. Get a tree listing of the files in `cpts215`\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the commands you entered to perform the above steps (and the commands' output) into a text file called `ma1_folder_commands.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Program (20 pts)\n",
    "Write a program (`primality_test.py`) that prompts the user for an integer, `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Define a predicate function, `is_prime(n)`, that accepts an integer argument `n` and returns `True` if `n` is prime, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural number (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and the number itself. Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if a number is prime or not, implement the trial division approach below (adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test)):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Given an input number `n`, check whether any prime integer `m` from 2 to $\\sqrt{n}$ evenly divides `n` (the division leaves no remainder). If `n` is divisible by any `m` then `n` is composite, otherwise it is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, we can do a trial division to test the primality of 100. Let's look at all the divisors of 100:\n",
    "\n",
    ">2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50\n",
    "\n",
    ">Here we see that the largest factor is 100/2 = 50. This is true for all `n`: all divisors are less than or equal to `n / 2`. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: If we take a closer look at the divisors, we will see that some of them are redundant. If we write the list differently:\n",
    "\n",
    ">100 = 2 × 50 = 4 × 25 = 5 × 20 = 10 × 10 = 20 × 5 = 25 × 4 = 50 × 2\n",
    "\n",
    ">the redundancy becomes obvious. Once we reach 10, which is $\\sqrt{100}$, the divisors just flip around and repeat. Therefore, we can further eliminate testing divisors greater than $\\sqrt{n}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use functions where appropriate!\n",
    "\n",
    "Example outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Please enter an integer >= 2: 100\n",
    "100 is not prime!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please enter an integer >= 2: 17\n",
    "17 is prime!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please enter an integer >= 2: 97\n",
    "97 is prime!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus (2 pts)\n",
    "Extend your previous program to prompt the user for an integer, `M`. Sum all of the prime numbers from 2 to `M`. In your solution, include a function called `sum_primes()` that accepts an integer `M` as an argument and returns the sum of all primes from 2 to `M`. "
