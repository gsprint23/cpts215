    "### Implementation Question\n",
    "In CptS 121/131 you learned how to write a recursive function to solve a solution through a maze. The maze was represented as a 2 dimensional array of cells. Each cell was either open or an \"X\", which represented a wall. The solution you derived was a backtracking algorithm that tried many different paths (probably something like right, down, left, up). If the algorithm hit a dead end it would back track, trying a different path. The solution of the backtracking algorithm was not optimal. Using graphs, we can find the shortest path from the start point to the end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent a maze as a graph by adding a vertex for the start, the end, each decision point (i.e. an intersection), and a vertex for each dead end. The edges represent connections in the maze between locations (our graph vertices). Each edge will be unweighted, meaning we are ignoring the length of the connection in terms of the number of cells in the maze. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define a 16x16 semi-difficult maze. Include your maze as an image in your notebook, code it up as a 2D list, or visualize it using matplotlib. Construct a graph from your maze. Find the shortest path from the start vertex to the end vertex using a breadth-first search. The shortest path will represent the fewest number of vertices (decision points) in the graph, not the shortest distance in terms of the number of cells along the path. Display the shortest path and the number of decision points in the path."
