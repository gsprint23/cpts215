    "## Lab1 Introduction to Python (10 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learner Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Use the Spyder IDE\n",
    "* Run Python interactively via the IPython shell\n",
    "* Save and run Python programs (scripts)\n",
    "* Compose Python programs that make use of\n",
    "    * Data types\n",
    "    * Variables\n",
    "    * Basic arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Install Anaconda 3.5 Python distribution\n",
    "* Access Spyder IDE\n",
    "* Apply basic problem solving strategies\n",
    "* Summarize key Python language elements, including\n",
    "    * Standard and user-defined identifiers\n",
    "    * Python reserved keywords\n",
    "    * Comments\n",
    "    * Operators\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Lab Format\n",
    "#### Task 0 and Pair Task\n",
    "Task 0 will be completed as a group with step-by-step guidance from your TA. After Task 0, your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
    "* Help your peers\n",
    "* Work on additional tasks\n",
    "* Work on the current programming assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Take advantage of your TA and your peers as resources and make the most of lab time!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Review Labs\n",
    "Labs 6 and 11 will be \"review\" labs where you solve/demo tasks you have not previously solved:\n",
    "1. Lab 6 (week 7): A certain number of tasks from Labs 1-6.\n",
    "1. Lab 11 (week 12): A certain number of tasks from Labs 7-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, it is to your benefit to work on the additional tasks now with the help of your TA and peers (and it will save you time later!)."

The resulting text in the console is an error that attempts to inform you where and why the error occurred. Reading this text will help you *debug* your code and figure out what went wrong.
