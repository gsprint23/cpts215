    "### Learner Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Call standard Python functions\n",
    "* Define functions\n",
    "* Call programmer-defined functions\n",
    "* Pass arguments into functions\n",
    "* Return values from functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Apply basic arithmetic operations in Python\n",
    "* Read input from the user\n",
    "* Convert strings to numeric types\n",

    "### Lab Format\n",
    "#### Task 0 and Pair Task\n",
    "Task 0 will be completed as a group with step-by-step guidance from your TA. After Task 0, your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
    "* Help your peers\n",
    "* Work on additional tasks\n",
    "* Work on the current programming assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Take advantage of your TA and your peers as resources and make the most of lab time!\n",

    "Labs 6 and 11 will be \"review\" labs where you solve/demo tasks you have not previously solved:\n",
    "1. Lab 6 (week 7): A certain number of tasks from Labs 1-6.\n",
    "1. Lab 11 (week 12): A certain number of tasks from Labs 7-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, it is to your benefit to work on the additional tasks now with the help of your TA and peers (and it will save you time later!)."
