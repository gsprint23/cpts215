    "\n",
    "### Learner Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Use Turtle graphics\n",
    "* Define and call functions that execute Turtle graphics code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Call standard Python functions\n",
    "* Define functions\n",
    "* Call programmer-defined functions\n",
    "* Pass arguments into functions\n",
    "* Return values from functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Format\n",
    "#### Task 0 and Pair Task\n",
    "Task 0 will be completed as a group with step-by-step guidance from your TA. After Task 0, your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
    "* Help your peers\n",
    "* Work on additional tasks\n",
    "* Work on the current programming assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Take advantage of your TA and your peers as resources and make the most of lab time!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Review Labs\n",
    "Labs 6 and 11 will be \"review\" labs where you solve/demo tasks you have not previously solved:\n",
    "1. Lab 6 (week 7): A certain number of tasks from Labs 1-6.\n",
    "1. Lab 11 (week 12): A certain number of tasks from Labs 7-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logically, it is to your benefit to work on the additional tasks now with the help of your TA and peers (and it will save you time later!)."

    "For this task (and other tasks in this lab), we are going to use the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html) module. Imagine a turtle standing at the origin (0,0) of an x-y canvas. For fun, let's name this turtle Crush (from Finding Nemo):\n",

Take a moment and read through the list of available turtle commands [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#overview-of-available-turtle-and-screen-methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common turtle methods (methods are functions that are associated with an object):\n",
    "1. `forward(<number of pixels)`: moves the turtle forward a specified number of pixels\n",
    "1. `backward(<number of pixels)`: moves the turtle backward a specified number of pixels\n",
    "1. `left(<number of degrees>)`: rotates the turtle counter clockwise a specified number of degrees\n",
    "1. `right(<number of degrees>)`: rotates the turtle clockwise a specified number of degrees\n",
    "1. `setpos(<x coordinate>, <y coordinate>)`: moves the turtle to the x, y coordinate arguments\n",
    "1. `speed(<integer speed>)`: increase the animation speed. An argument of 0 indicates the fastest drawing speed. See other speed options[here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed)\n",
    "1. `penup()`: lifts the pen up so the turtle does not draw on the canvas when he/she moves\n",
    "1. `pendown()`: lowers the pen to the canvas so the turtle does draw when he/she moves\n",
    "1. `pencolor(<color string>)`: changes the pen color. See the available pen colors [here](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm)\n",
    "1. `pensize(<integer width>)`: changes the pen size to the specified width\n",
    "1. `shape(<turtle string>)`: change the turtle \"cursor\". See the available shapes [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#turtle.shape)\n",
    "1. Much more!\n",

    "Note: To do this task, we will declare our turtle object (i.e. `my_turtle`) as a global variable, before the definitions of the functions that we are binding to keys. This is because we cannot specify the arguments into our binded functions. In general, we try to avoid using global variables; however, we have not learned enough of Python (yet) to do this in a more elegant way, stay tuned!"
